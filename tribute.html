      <h2>Here is a timeline of Abdul Kalam's life.</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1931 - Abdul Kalam was born into a Muslim family on October 15, 1931, on the island of Dhanushkodi off the southeastern coast of India.</li>
        <li>1958 - Kalam instead joined the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) as a senior scientific assistant in 1958.</li>
        <li>1969 - After moving to the newly formed Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) in 1969, he was named project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle designed and produced on Indian soil.</li>
        <li>1982 -Kalam implemented the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program.</li>
        <li>1992 - He then became the senior scientific adviser to India's defense minister in 1992, a position he used to campaign for the development of nuclear tests. </li>
        <li>1998 - Kalam was a key figure in the May 1998 Pokhran-II tests, in which five nuclear devices were detonated in the Rajasthan Desert. Although the tests resulted in condemnation and economic sanctions from other world powers, Kalam was hailed as a national hero for his staunch defense of the countryâ€™s security.</li>
        <li>2002 - In 2002, India's ruling National Democratic Alliance helped Kalam win an election against Lakshmi Sahgal and become India's 11th president, a largely ceremonial post. Known as the People's President, Kalam set a goal of conducting 500,000 one-on-one meetings with young people over the course of his five-year term. His immense popularity led to him being nominated by MTV for a Youth Icon of the Year award in 2003 and 2006. </li>
        <li>2007 - After leaving office in 2007, Kalam became a visiting professor at several universities. He formed the "What Can I Give Movement" in 2011 with the goal of creating a compassionate society, and in 2012, his efforts to improve healthcare led to the release of a tablet for medical personnel to use in remote areas. </li>
        <li>2015 - On July 27, 2015, Kalam suffered a massive heart attack while lecturing at the Indian Institute of Management and subsequently died at the age of 83. </li>
         </ul>
